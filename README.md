Analysis 5 Summative Assignment

Assignment made in Python

The assignment is a simulation of 2 clients (both in the script) that communicate between eachother and a schoolserver set up by the teacher.
To run a correct simulation you need to run the code in 2 instances.

The code should be run using the CMD or any equivalent of that.

                                          py [FILE_NAME] [IP_CLIENT2] [1 == client1, 2 == client2]
Example client 1: C:\Users\Patryk\Desktop>py Networking_Assignment.py 192.168.1.10 1

Example client 2: C:\Users\Patryk\Desktop>py Networking_Assignment.py 192.168.1.10 2
